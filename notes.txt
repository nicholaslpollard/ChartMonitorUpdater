Full Workflow Overview
1. stockMonitor.js — Scans Stocks

Purpose: Monitors a list of stocks and evaluates them against historical strategies or backtests to identify potential opportunities.

Steps:

Load the list of stocks to monitor.

For each stock, apply your best win rate scenarios (strategies with highest historical success).

Evaluate the stock based on:

Current price (spotPrice)

Trend (Up/Down)

Signal (Buy/Sell)

Risk level (Low/Medium/High)

Expected move (historical or calculated)

Store alerts for stocks that meet your criteria (e.g., high win rate, favorable trend, strong signal).

Save these alerts to a JSON file, e.g., Chart Monitor/alerts/stockAlerts.json.

Output: List of stock alerts with all relevant data (signal, trend, expected move, etc.).

2. chartOptionBridge.js — Bridges Stocks to Options

Purpose: Takes stock alerts and finds corresponding options to analyze for actionable trades.

Steps:

Read stockAlerts.json from stockMonitor.js.

For each stock alert, retrieve options from your option chain data (or call optionChainTest.js).

For each option, gather key data:

Strike price, type (call/put)

Market price, Black-Scholes price (bsPrice)

Diff percentage (diffPct)

Moneyness (ITM/ATM/OTM)

Implied volatility (iv)

Spread and liquidity

Pass the options and stock alert together into the decision-making engine.

Output: Combined stock + option dataset for each alert, ready for decision evaluation.

3. optionChainTest.js — Evaluates Options

Purpose: Runs detailed analysis on individual options to identify underpriced/overpriced contracts and potential trades.

Steps:

Accept a stock symbol and its options from chartOptionBridge.js.

Calculate option metrics:

Black-Scholes theoretical price

diffPct between market and BS price

Compare implied volatility, spread, and liquidity

Return a detailed JSON object with each option's analysis, including:

suggestedAction

riskLevel

Entry, stop-loss, and take-profit suggestions (if enabled)

Save or return the results to chartOptionBridge.js.

Output: Option analysis results for each stock alert.

4. chartOptionBridge.js — Combines Stock + Option Analysis

Purpose: Merge stock signals with option evaluations to generate fully informed action recommendations.

Steps:

Take stock alerts + option test results.

Use your decision tree or decision sheet:

Match option parameters (diffPct, moneyness, iv, spread, liquidity)

Consider stock signal (Buy/Sell) and trend (Up/Down)

Generate a final recommendation:

Suggested action (e.g., “Strong buy OTM call”, “Long stock”, “Monitor”)

Risk level

Entry, stop-loss, take-profit points

Detailed rationale explaining why the action is suggested

Save the combined output to decisionSheet.json.

Output: Decision sheet with combined, actionable recommendations for all monitored stocks/options.

5. Decision Sheet → Email Alerts

Purpose: Notify you with a full, informed call to action.

Steps:

Read decisionSheet.json.

Format each recommendation for email:

Stock symbol and option details

Suggested action

Risk level

Entry, stop-loss, take-profit

Brief explanation of why the trade is favorable

Send a structured email alert for all entries in the decision sheet.

Output: Real-time email alerts for actionable stock and option trades.

6. Optional: Re-iteration Loop

Once a decision sheet is generated, you can:

Continue monitoring updated stock prices and option chains

Refresh stockAlerts.json and rerun the workflow

Keep your decision tree updated dynamically with new incoming data

✅ Key Points of This Workflow

Stock alerts trigger option analysis automatically.

Options are evaluated with full metrics (diffPct, IV, moneyness, spread, liquidity).

Decision tree/decision sheet references both stock trends and option analytics to generate actionable guidance.

Final output includes entry points, stop-loss, take-profit, and risk assessment.
